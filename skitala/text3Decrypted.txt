While there are clear commonalities between the BABOK and PMBOK Knowledge Areas, each has its own 
uniqueness when explored in depth.  An orientation to project management versus business analysis is 
a clear distinction.  For example, it is the project manager’s job to ensure that the scope is well 
defined.  It might be a business analyst who is delegated that responsibility as part of the team.  Or, 
it could be a small enough project where the project manager defines the scope and even gathers the 
detailed requirements.  In such a situation, you could say that the project manager is playing multiple
 roles.Given these commonalities, it is not surprising that business analysis training, including business 
analysis certification exam prep, often qualifies for Professional Development units (PDUs) to maintain 
Project Management Professional (PMP) certification.  Part 3, the last of this series of articles,
 explores the relationship between business analysis and project management – and most important what 
 that means to you, and examines why you, as a project manager, might want to consider business analysis 
 certification
