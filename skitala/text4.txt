As of 31 March 2022, PMI has started the phased process of retiring or "sunsetting", the PMBOK® Guide
 – Sixth Edition. Stakeholders may continue to purchase print copies through retailers and resellers,
 but only while supplies last. Once the stock is depleted, PMI will not reprint additional copies of 
 the Sixth Edition.
However, we know that many professionals, especially those preparing for the CAPM® exam still refer to 
and use the Sixth Edition in their daily work. Therefore, we are maintaining several different ways 
stakeholders can access the content for the foreseeable future.
PMI members can download a free PDF of the edition and non-members will be able to purchase it in an 
eBook format, both in English and other languages currently supported. Stakeholders can gain digital 
access to the PMBOK® Guide –Sixth Edition content via PMIstandards+™. PMI members can access it free, 
and non-members can access it via a monthly subscription. The Sixth Edition will remain available through 
select Library Subscription Services where prior licensing agreements are in place.
The PMBOK® Guide – Seventh Edition carries the ANSI-accredited Standard for Project Management, so we 
recommend syllabi be based on this edition. But please note, after the evaluation of the content, select 
concepts from the Sixth Edition are still viable project management practices. For example, we recognize 
and support the Process Groups Model outlined in the Sixth Edition as one of several valid and reliable 
models. Therefore, we are developing a new resource dedicated to supporting the Process Groups Model, with 
plans to announce it later this year.
